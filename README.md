# MagicPhotos

MagicPhotos  lets  you  quickly  and  easily give photos a dramatic look by
applying  different  effects  while  keeping your chosen details untouched.
This draws the viewer's attention to the individual image details, creating
striking images.

With   its   intuitive   and   responsive  user  interface, MagicPhotos  is
super easy and fun to use. You simply use your finger as a brush  to  apply
effects  to  certain  regions of your image or bring back original  image.

Photo   editor   supports  multiple  effects  (Decolorize  (Color  Splash),
Recolor,   Sketch,  Cartoon and so on) and Photo Retouch mode that lets you
remove  small  flaws  and unwanted content (watermarks, people, text, power
lines as well as other unwanted objects) from your photos, as well as apply
controlled   blur  to  selected  details  of  photo  you would like to hide
(license  plates,  human  faces  and so on).

Please  visit [project website](https://magicphotos.sourceforge.io/) to get
additional information.
